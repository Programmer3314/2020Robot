***Actions***
Control Panel | revolutions 3 - 5 | color sensor | Camera
Climb | mini SIM | enocder and switch || 2 switches | 2 Lasers - Bar is level when it breaks both Sensors
shooter | control convey belt | motor brush | motor controller | encoder | 
ball Queuing | mini sim | 


***Motors & Encoders***
1 Bag Motors | Turn Table  - Rotate Hood | Vera planetary encoder
4 Falcons | Drive Train
2 Neos | Shooter
1 Mini Sim | Brushed Motor | Intake
1/2 Motor | Intake Track
1 Mini Sim | Move on Climber Bar
1 Bag Motor | Control Panel | 
1 <= ??? motor(s) | Queuing Balls

***Sensors***
>= 2 Pairs of Sensors | Queuing Balls | 1 before the Shooter | A few more along the tracking

***Pneumatics***
1 Small Piston | Control Panel Manipulator

*****Ball Intake*****
Mini SIM

*****Ball Queuing*****
????? Motors = using Conveyor belt to move balls in robot



















***Driving Mode***
    {Motor Encoder, Gamepad Arcade Style,}
    Chase ball{Camera turn by vision, forward from human control}
    Drive along trench{Driver controlled speed, ultrasonic sensor, gyro, color sensor, Balls in auto, camera to get angle of trench line on side}
    Target to high target tape{Camera to align with center of tape}
    Align to climb{Gyro to be perpindicular to bar}
    Line up from Control Panel{Weight sensor to detect when hood rips off and back up 2 feet}

***Other Things***
    Pickup ball{Sensor for where the ball is in the intake, Motor ecoder, }
    Shoot{Adjust hood, Adjust motor speed (range) 
    Sensors{Motor Encoder, Prox. Sensor(s) for up and down pos}}
    Climb{Motor Encoder, Index of climber, Sensor for bar Leveling, Sensor for off ground}
    Manage queueing balls (to shooter)
    Spin Control Panel{Sensor for position of spinner motor, Motor Encoder, Color sensor(s), Camera?,  }
    Move along climbing bar
    Control shooter hood
    Driver camera Control{Switching camera, Draw on camera that is chosen }
