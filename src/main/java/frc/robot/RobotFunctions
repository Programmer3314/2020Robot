***Driving Mode***
    {Motor Encoder, Gamepad Arcade Style,}
    Chase ball{Camera turn by vision, forward from human control}
    Drive along trench{Driver controlled speed, ultrasonic sensor, gyro, color sensor, Balls in auto, camera to get angle of trench line on side}
    Target to high target tape{Camera to align with center of tape}
    Align to climb{Gyro to be perpindicular to bar}
